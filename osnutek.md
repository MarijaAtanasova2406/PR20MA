# Problem: Prediction on Black Friday Sales

One of the most popular sales nowadays is the Black Friday Sale that actually happens in a certain period of time in a year. People are following the trend and buying different things. The main point itâ€™s to predict who is more likely to spend money, women or men, from which city, at what age and so on.

The following questions regarding to this problem are:

1. Who is most likely to spend money on Black Friday, men or women?
2. Should the age be considered in this type od problem? 
3. How much is the occupation important for spending money?
4. Are married people more likely to spend money, than single, or vice versa?
5. Which category is the bestselling product? 
    
I am going to use the dataset given on Kaggle, called BlackFriday.csv with the size of 23.8 MB. 

The link to this dataset is public and it is the following: https://www.kaggle.com/llopesolivei/blackfriday/data

The data is actually divided in several categories such as: **User_Id**, **Product_Id**, **Gender**, **Age**, **Occupation**, **City_Category**, **Stay_In_Current_City_Years**, **Marital_Status**, **Product_Category_1**, **Product_Category_2**, **Product_Category_3** and **Purchase**. 

So, in this dataset we have:

- Intervals of age
- 3 categories of cities
- Boolean value of marital status (0 - single and 1 - married)
- Quantity of products divided in 3 categories
- Sum of purchased items.
